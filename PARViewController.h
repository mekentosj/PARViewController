/*
 
 NSViewController base subclass that ensures automatic insertion into the responder chain
 
 USAGE
 
 use as the base subclass, and don't worry about the respnder chain anymore: the view controller is guaranteed to be automatically inserted between the controlled NSView and the next responder that it would normally have in the absence of the view controller
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 before:  responder X  -->  view  -->  Responder Y
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 after:   responder X  -->  view  -->  view controller -->  Responder Y
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 NOTES
 
 - The view will not be in the responder chain unless it overrides `acceptsFirstResponder` to return YES
 and the controller will not be in the responder chain if the view is not in the responder chain.
 see: http://katidev.com/blog/2008/07/24/simple-nsviewcontroller-sample-projects/
 
 - The view will still end up in the responder chain if one of the subviews responds YES to `acceptsFirstResponder`, for example if it contains an NSTableView
